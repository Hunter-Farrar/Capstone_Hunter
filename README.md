# Motivation

What motivated me to pick this topic was the conversation my father and I had about clean energies and how important they are.


# What I plan to do

- Find the consumption rates of renewable energies
- Discover which month had the most consumption for each form of renewable energies
- Find the top 5 states that produced the most percentage of the U.S. total of energy in 2022
- Find the top 5 states with the most amount of energy consumed
